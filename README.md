# InfoNomz (pictures coming soon)
InfoNomz is a web extension tool that keeps track of your media consumption and converts this data into useful statistics. InfoNomz notably analyzes news media that you consume on a daily basis, and sorts any political content into a specific political leaning, based on that website's historical political leaning, with the help of [AllSides Media Bias Ratings](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias).
