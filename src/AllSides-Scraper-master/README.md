## AllSides Scraper

Script that uses Cheerio and Request libraries to scrape AllSide.com to get bias ratings for new sites.

## Motivation

Used in conjunction with NewsGate, a project that I worked on as part of a group at HackReactor to detect fake news via a chrome extension.

## Installation

Run npm install and then npm start to run the script. The results will be written into the biasRatings file.

## Future Plans

Replace the callbacks with promises and clean up the code further. Add other data values such as the wikipedia article and the summary.

Thanks for reading! :)
